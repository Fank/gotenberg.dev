[Gotenberg](https://github.com/gotenberg/gotenberg) is a Docker-powered stateless API for PDF files. In other words:

* It's a Docker image containing all the required dependencies; no need to install them on each environment.
* It scales smoothly and works nicely in a distributed context.
* It provides `multipart/form-data` endpoints for converting numerous document formats into PDF files, and more!
* It has HTTP/2 support (H2C).
